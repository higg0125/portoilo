    <h1>Sara's Home Page </h1>
<p>Hello, my name is Sara Xin Allison Higgins. 
    I am a student at Algonquin College in Interactive Media Design. This is my website for all of my digital creations. Hope you can enjoy looking at them, as much I did to create them.
     I have a portfolio for my photography as well.</p>
